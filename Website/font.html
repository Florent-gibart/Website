            Takashi Murakami (村上 隆, Murakami Takashi, born February 1, 1962) is a Japanese contemporary artist. 
            He works in fine arts media (such as painting and sculpture) as well as commercial media (such as fashion,
            merchandise, and animation) and is known for blurring the line between high and low arts.
            He coined the term "superflat", which describes both the aesthetic characteristics of the Japanese
            artistic tradition and the nature of post-war Japanese culture and society,
            and is also used for Murakami's artistic style and other Japanese artists he has influenced.
